### Time-Series Forecasting
#### 1. Use the results of the time series analysis and modeling to answer the following questions:

* Based on your time series analysis, would you buy the yen now?
No given that the pvalues of the models are not significant (greater than 0.05), not to mentioned that both models provided opposite recomendations 
* Is the risk of the yen expected to increase or decrease?
the risk of the yen is expected to increase in the near term. The p values in the Garch model is significant 
* Based on the model evaluation, would you feel confident in using these models for trading?
not really, more features are needed to make the models significant and robust. 

### Linear Regression Forecasting
#### 2. Use the results of the linear regression analysis and modeling to answer the following question:

* Does this model perform better or worse on out-of-sample data compared to in-sample data?
The model performs better out of sample than in-sample. the 
Out-of-Sample Root Mean Squared Error is (RMSE): 0.41 while the In-sample Root Mean Squared Error (RMSE): is 0.56. normally Out of sample error tend to be higher.
